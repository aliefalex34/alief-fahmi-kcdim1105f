                <p>

                    My family is a close knit and lively group of four. My dad, Sholehan, is 53 years old
                    and work as a Construction site project owner. He is one of the hardest workers I know,
                    spending long hours building and supervising projects. Despite his busy schedule, he always
                    makes time for us and shares stories about his day, which I find fascinating. My mom Azura, is 45
                    years old is a dedicated housewife. She manages the houseold with so much care, from cooking
                    delicious meals to making sure everyone's needs are taken care of. She's the heart of our home and
                    keeps everything running smoothly.

                    <br>

                    I have a sibling, which is my older brother Nazrul. He is 24 years old by this years and are also currently
                    pursuing his studies in the program of Finance Administration in the same university I goes to which is Universiti 
                    Teknologi Mara Cawangan Sungai Petani. Coincidentally, we both are a semester 5 students but he still has one more semester
                    while I only have 5 semester in my program. He has a really high interest in photography and always prioritize pjotography as 
                    it is his hobby. My family have 2 british shorthair cats named Luna and Bella, who are always energetics and playful and bring
                    a lot of smile to us

                    <br>

                    As a family, we enjoy spending time together, whether it's going for a holiday occasionally, working on a car with my dad, or simply
                    sitting down for dinner and talking about our day. My parents have created home filled with love, support, and plenty of
                    laughter
